# F95API

Unofficial Typescript API used for data scraping from the F95Zone platform.

These APIs have been developed to support [this application](https://github.com/MillenniumEarl/YAM) and allow you to obtain data on games and mods on the platform [F95zone](https://f95zone.to/) (**NSFW**)

A simple usage example can be found in [src/example.ts](https://github.com/MillenniumEarl/F95API/blob/master/src/example.ts)

# Main features
- Support for two-factor authentication
- Structured and typed data of games, mods, comics, assets and animations
- Structured and typed data of the current user (threads followed, favorites...)
- Structured and typed data of other users (titles, donations, registration date...)
- Standard search, through the "Latest Updates" page or advanced
- Saving of cookies to maintain the session

# Login
In addition to traditional login, two-factor authentication via callback that returns the OTP value is also supported.

```javascript
// Normal login
let result = await F95API.login(username, password);

// 2FA login
let 2faCallback = function () => Promise<number>;
let result = await F95API.login(username, password, 2faCallback);
````

Refer to [src/example.ts](https://github.com/MillenniumEarl/F95API/blob/master/src/example.ts#L35-L67) (lines 35-67) for a working example.

# Data scraping
Each game, mod, comic, animation or asset is identified as handiwork and obtaining this element is generic, it will then be up to the user to decide which property to use based on the type of handiwork that has been requested.

Handiworks can be obtained by query or by URL.

```javascript
// With query
const query = {
    category: "games";
    keywords = "Your game name";
    order = "likes";
};

let listOfFoundGames = await F95API.searchHandiwork<Game>(query);

// With URL
let specificGame = await F95API.getHandiworkFromURL<Game>("the URL of your game");
```

While user data (after authenticating) with 

```javascript
const userdata = new UserProfile();

// Fetch basic data (always necessary)
await userdata.fetch();

// Fetch all data (may take a while)
await userdata.fetch(true);

// Async properties
const threads = await userdata.watched;
const bookmarks = await userdata.bookmarks;
const alerts = await userdata.alerts;
const games = await userdata.featuredGames;
```

# Classes
## Handiwork

## User data

The user data currently connected through this API extends the [PlatformUser](https://github.com/MillenniumEarl/F95API/blob/master/src/scripts/classes/mapping/platform-user.ts) class via the class [UserProfile](https://github.com/MillenniumEarl/F95API/blob/master/src/scripts/classes/mapping/user-profile.ts) and adds:

| Property         | Type                        | Description   |

| :-------:|:--------:|:--------------|
| `success`| `boolean`| List of followed thread data|
| `code`   | `number` | Code associated with the result of the login operation|
| `message`| `string` | Possible error message (unrecognized user, wrong password...) or authentication successful message|

# Logging
To log the behavior of the application [log4js-api](https://github.com/log4js-node/log4js-api) is used with a default level of "warn". This option can be changed with the `loggerLevel` property.

# Guidelines for errors

- If you can, return a meaningful value
- Return `null` only if the function should return a complex object (including strings)
- Return an empty array if the function should return an array
- Return `false`, `-1` when the function should return `boolean` or `number`
- Throw an exception only if it is an error or if a wrong value could mess up the functioning of the library
- For all network operations, return a `Result` object
